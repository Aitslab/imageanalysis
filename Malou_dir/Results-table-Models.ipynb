    "- Model 2: Trained with the same images as Model 1, and with elastic transformation done 9 times on each of the 30 \n",
    "training images, so that the total amount of training images is 300.\n",
    "- Model 2.2: Model 2 evaluated with affine transformation done on the validation set.\n",
    "- Model 3: The same as Model 2, with 100 additional images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4: The same as Model 2, with 200 additional images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4.4: Model 4, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 5: The same as Model 4 with additional 500 randomly selected images from the image collections BBBC038, BBBC020, \"GFP-GOWT1 mouse stem cells\", \"HeLa cells stably expressing H2b-GFP\" and \"Simulated nuclei of HL60 cells stained with Hoescht\"\n",
    "- Model 5.5: Model 5, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 6: Training with 2 images from Aitslab\n",
    "- Model 7: Training with 5 images from Aitslab\n",
    "- Model 8: Training with 15 images from Aitslab\n",
    "- Model 9: Model 1 trained for additional 15 epochs\n",
    "- Model 10: Model 1 and 29 additional images from the BBBC038, handpicked based on similarity to aits images.\n",
    "- Model 11: Training with the 29 additional images used in Model 10.\n",
    "- Model 12: Same as Model 10, with the 29 additional images resized to the same size as aitsimages (1104x1104).\n",
