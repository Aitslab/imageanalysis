    "- Model 3: The same as Model 2, but with 100 images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4: The same as Model 2, but with 200 images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 5: The same as Model 4 but with additional 500 images from the BBBC group\n",
    "- Model 5*: Model 5 with no augmented images with affine transformation (Model 1 + 700 additional BBBC images)\n",
