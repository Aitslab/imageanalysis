    "### Description of the models\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Model 1: Trained with 6 manually annotated images, 4 for training, 2 for validation.\n",
    "- Model 2: Model using 15 annotated images 10/5 split. Images annotated using merged images (channel 0 and 1 merged), but input images for model is only d1 images.\n",
    "- Model 3: Same as model 2, but the input images are the merged images.\n",
    "- Model 4: Model with 15 annotated images (cellannotationset1), with larger borders of the objects. merged images as input\n",
    "- Model 5: used extra weight on boundaries, 20 for boundaries. 1 for interior. 1 for background.\n",
    "- Model 6: Model created using probmaps from model3, input are the probmab, validation are the annotations.\n",
    "- Model 7: Trained with 5 newly annotated images, annotated from brightened images. input images are the brightened images.\n",
    "- Model 8: As model 7 but with the normalized images as input.\n",
    "- Model 9: model with cellannotationset1 + cellannotationset2 (total 21 images), with norm_images as input\n",
    "- Model 37-cell: Model created as nuclei model 5 but trained with 15 additional images from the cell channel, Evaluated on cell images.\n",
    "- Model 12: Model created as model 9, but with less weight put on boundaries weight parameters changed from [1.,1.,10.] to [1.,1.,5.] \n",
    "- Model 13: Model created as model 9, but with less weight put on boundaries weight parameters changed from [1.,1.,10.] to [1.,1.,1.]\n",
    "- Model 14: Model created with cellannotationset1 + 2 and 58 images from the datasets BBBC020 and CCDB_6843.\n",
