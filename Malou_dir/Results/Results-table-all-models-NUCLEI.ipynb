    "- Model F3: Filips Model 3\n",
    "- Model 1: Trained with 40 images from Aits lab, 30 for training, 10 for validation.\n",
    "- Model 1.1: Model 1, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 2: Trained with the same images as Model 1, and with elastic transformation done 9 times on each of the 30 training images, so that the total amount of training images is 300.\n",
    "- Model 2.2: Model 2 evaluated with affine transformation done on the validation set.\n",
    "- Model 3: The same as Model 2, with 100 additional images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4: The same as Model 2, with 200 additional images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4.4: Model 4, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 5: The same as Model 4 with additional 500 randomly selected images from the image collections BBBC038, BBBC020, \\\"GFP-GOWT1 mouse stem cells\\\", \\\"HeLa cells stably expressing H2b-GFP\\\" and \\\"Simulated nuclei of HL60 cells stained with Hoescht\\\"\n",
    "- Model 5.1: Model 5, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",

    "- Model 18: Model 1, with modification to the weight parameter of the boundary label. backround, interior and boundary now has the same value instead of 1/1/10. No dilation done in the evaluation step now.\n",
    "- Model 19: Model 13 trained for additional 5 epochs\n",
    "- Model 20: Same images as Model 1, but boundary labels created differently, objects are increased in size and then applied 2 pixel boundaries, one inside of object, and one outside.\n",
    "- Model 21: Same images as Model 1, but 2 pixel boundaries.\n",
    "- Model 22: Model 20 trained for 5 additional epochs.\n",
    "- Model 24: Model created with same images as Model 1, but with boundaries created as the original BBBC model (2 pixels boundary). Objects less than 40 pixels removed before training\n",
    "- Model 25: Model created with image set 2, and objects less than 25 pixels removed before training.\n",
    "- Model 26: Model created with image set 2, and objects less than 100 pixels removed before training.\n",
    "- Model 27: Same images as Model 1, with the normalized images as 16-bit instead of 8-bit.\n",
    "- Model 28: Training with image set 3 (annotations with focus on the bright part in cells).\n",
    "- Model 30: Model 1 evaluated on BBBC's validation set\n",
    "- Model 31: BBBC Model evaluated on Aits VALIDATION set\n",
    "- Model 32: Model created with corrected annotations + 15 newly annotated images. \n",
    "- Model 33:This model is created with an edited image set, where annotations are done on the outer border of the cell, even if the cell has a bright part inside. \n",
    "- Model 34: Same as 33, but removed blurred images from the dataset. micronuclei(<100 pixels) Excluded from evaluation\n",
    "- Model 35: Model created with merged images, nuclei and cell channels are merged in to RGB images, where the B channel is 0.\n",
    "- Model 37-nuclei: Model created as model 5 but trained with 15 additional images from the cell channel, Evaluated on nuclei images.\n",
    "- Model 38: Trained as image 1, but with 3 channel merged images as input.  \n",
    "- Model 39: Trained as 38, but without using the percentile normalization on the images. \n",
    "- Model 40: Model 38, but the optimizer changed to Adam\n",
