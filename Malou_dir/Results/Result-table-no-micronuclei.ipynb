    "- Model F3: Filips Model 3\n",
    "- Model 1: Model evaluation done with raw annotations as ground truth.\n",
    "- Model 1.1: Model 1, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 2: Trained with the same images as Model 1, and with elastic transformation done 9 times on each of the 30 training images, so that the total amount of training images is 300.\n",
    "- Model 2.2: Model 2 evaluated with affine transformation done on the validation set.\n",
    "- Model 3: The same as Model 2, with 100 additional images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4: The same as Model 2, with 200 additional images from BBBC\n",
    "- Model 4.4: Model 4, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 5: The same as Model 4 with additional 500 randomly selected images from the image collections BBBC038, BBBC020, \\GFP-GOWT1 mouse stem cells\\, \\HeLa cells stably expressing H2b-GFP\\ and \\Simulated nuclei of HL60 cells stained with Hoescht\\\n",
    "- Model 5.1: Model 5, evaluated on images from other labs.\n",
    "- Model 9: Model 1 trained for additional 15 epochs\n",
    "- Model 10: Model 1 and 29 additional images from the BBBC038, handpicked based on similarity to aits images.\n",
    "- Model 12: Same as Model 10, with the 29 additional images resized to the same size as aitsimages (1104x1104).\n",
    "- Model 13: Aits images with affine transformation + 333 images from BBBC038\n",
    "- Model 14: Model 3 trained for 15 additional epochs\n",
    "- Model 14 VAL2 : Model 14, evaluated on edited annotation (validation set 2)\n",
    "- Model 35: Model created with merged images, nuclei and cell channels are merged in to RGB images, where the B channel is 0.\n",
    "- Model 38: Model created with merged images, nuclei, cell and mitochondria channel merged. \n",
    "- Model 39: Trained as 38, but without using the percentile normalization on the images. No Micronuclei\n",
