    "#### Project: \n",
    "Image analysis for high-throughput microscopy screening\n",

    "#### Aim: \n",
    "To understand how the hoVer-Net is built and what part of the github code belongs to what in the architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stepwise description of work:\n",
    "* Read the papers about HoVer-Net to truly understand its concept\n",
    "* Try to extract code which belongs to each part of the model code\n",
    "* Try to filter out the part which belongs to classification\n",
    "* Create a notebook for example code comment your results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result/Conclusion: \n",
    "After having a hard time understanding the HoVer-Net and its underlying structure, I found a great video which explains the concepts thoroughly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDauqZdUCE and now I understand each part of the architecture and what its benefits are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through the code in the HoVer-Net github repositoty, was great for getting some connection between intuition and code and I created some trivial comments in a newly created notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next steps: \n",
    "* Get a deeper understanding how input is passed into the model\n",
    "* Understand how to use Cvat\n",
    "* Annotate some images\n",
    "* Setting up our own segmentation model based on code in the ***example_code.ipynb*** notebook\n",
