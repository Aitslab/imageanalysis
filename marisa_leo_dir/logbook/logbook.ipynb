    "#### Stepwise description of work:\n",
    "* Read the papers about HoVer-Net to truly understand its concept\n",

    "After having a hard time understanding the HoVer-Net and its underlying structure, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841519301045?via%3Dihub, I found a great video which explains the concepts thoroughly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDauqZdUCE and now I understand each part of the architecture and what its benefits are.\n",
