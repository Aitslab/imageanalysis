Images/objects that need to be excluded:

    Empty field: no cells in samples which have very high cell death
    Foreign object: dust particles, damaged plate bottom, bacterial or fungal contamination
    Out of focus - entire image
    Out of focus - individual cells
    Clumped cells
    Fragmented cells
    Overlapping cells
    Unusual illumination errors (besides what we have on every plate)
    Image corruption - entire image
    Image corruption - partial image


Other QC issues:

    Uneven illumination across plates => illumination correction
    Uneven illumination within individual images/wells
    Recurrent pixel artefacts (e.g. detector damage)
    Batch effects from week to week (differences in illumination, stain intensity, transfection efficiency, cell number and “untreated” cell status)
    systematic effects related to order of plate processing (16 plates were processed in each experiment)
    whole-plate effects (left side of plate different from right, centre different from outer wells due to uneven evaporation “edge effect”)
    pipetting errors affecting one column/row/well (every week or just once)
    cell population-dependent effects (cells unevenly distributed across well)
    Altered autofluorescence
    Image corruption - partial image or recurrent pixel artefacts
